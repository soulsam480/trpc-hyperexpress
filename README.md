## tRPC-HyperExpress
> tRPC adapter for HyperExpress

### Why ?
- [HyperExpress](https://github.com/kartikk221/hyper-express) is fast, like really fast and has much higher throughoutput than fastify. See the benchmarks
- I freaking love tRPC and the typesafety it brings.

### How ?
I just copied everything from [https://github.com/trpc/trpc/tree/main/packages/server/src/adapters/fastify](https://github.com/trpc/trpc/tree/main/packages/server/src/adapters/fastify). 


### Credits
